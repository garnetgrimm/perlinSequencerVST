# Perlin Based Midi Sequencer VST
![Screenshot](sc.png)

## Setup
This plugin is based on JUCE, so If you wanna compile this you should install the JUCE and VST3 sdks. This will provide you with Projuicer which you can use to generate the project for your desired IDE. For this project specifically, I recommend Visual Studio for windows.
